# daoOS

This project complies with [`SyvR-v4`](https://github.com/labs3/standards/releases/tag/v4).

## Background

Bitcoin was the first Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO. DAOs empower groups of people to organize in a decentralized fashion to prioritize tasks and execute on projects. daoOS is an open source tool that can empower DAOs to organize, vote on priorities, and execute through a single interface. The key problem with decentralized organizations is that it can be challenging organizing around central principals and determining how and what to fund. The result can be unnecessary bureaucracy and often there ends up being some kind of centralized board or leaders who end up making all of the decisions and others can have issues getting their priorities funded.

In a world where apps like Uber and Airbnb are decentralized, it won't be done through a centralized startup - it will be done through a group of drivers or homeowners who want to get it done. And that's where daoOS can provide the platform and process.

Our aim is to create tools that anyone can then use to create their own DAO. Empowering users to organize and fund projects in a decentralized fashion will be at the heart of a user owned internet.

## Project Overview

This app should empower the following for any DAO:

- Allowing members to sign up, be approved by the existing organization
- Members will be able to post ideas, and these ideas can be fleshed out, budgets and milestones can be set
- Members can then commit STX to projects they want to contribute to, when the full budget is met, they can begin working towards the milestones
- When a milestone is met, the project owner can post it and have STX released on approval of a majority of anyone who staked STX to that project. This continues until the project has reached completion.
- As we advance, we can refine these tools based on the needs of DAOs, and add elements like member subscriptions, the ability to de-couple contributions and voting power, the ability to stack the reserve STX, and whatever else is needed. The primary purpose at this stage will be to simple create an MVP, recruit new DAOs to use i t, and find product-market fit.
