;; daos-miami
;; This contract is an implementation of a DAO registry for Miami coin holders.
;; It maintains a registry of members and information about the DAO with operations to manipulate its state.
;; Modification of state is only permitted if the tx-sender is a passed proposal.
;; We trust a "core-proposal-contract" to be our arbiter of truth as to which proposals are "passed".
;; We delegate proposal management responsibilities to this separate core contract to adhere to
;; the "single responsibility principle"
;;
;; Anyone can be added by anyone to the DAO as a member (including prospective members admitting themselves)
;; as long as they have a token balance > 0 and haven't been blacklisted. Blacklisting is admittedly
;; a negligable impediment for this form of membership admission since a user can just create a new wallet.
;; However, it may be better to have than not have as well as demonstrate utility for other DAO implementations
